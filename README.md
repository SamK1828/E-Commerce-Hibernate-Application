# 🛒 E-Commerce Hibernate Application

This project is a simple **E-Commerce backend** built using **Hibernate** to demonstrate ORM concepts, entity relationships, and CRUD operations. It showcases step-by-step implementation of Hibernate mappings with a modular DAO structure.

## 🚀 Features

* **User CRUD** – Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for `User` entity.
* **One-to-One Mapping** – `User ↔ Address` relationship with cascade and orphan removal support.
* **(Upcoming)** One-to-Many – `User ↔ Orders`.
* **(Upcoming)** Many-to-Many – `Product ↔ Category`.
* **Hibernate Configuration** using `hibernate.cfg.xml` without Spring Data JPA.
* **DAO Layer** for clean database interaction.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Java 8+**
* **Hibernate ORM**
* **MySQL** (can be adapted to other RDBMS)
* **Maven** (for dependency management)

## 📂 Project Structure

```

## 🎯 Purpose

The project is designed for:

* Learning **Hibernate ORM** from scratch.
* Practicing **entity relationships** (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many).
* Demonstrating **CRUD operations without Spring Data JPA**.
* Serving as a **starter template** for Hibernate-based applications.
